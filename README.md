# Smart Solar Panel Monitoring & Prediction
This project integrates IoT devices, a backend with machine learning & chatbot, and a frontend dashboard to monitor, predict, and interact with solar panel performance in real time.

## 📌 Overview
The system collects real sensor data (power, temperature, humidity) via ESP32, sends it to a FastAPI backend where it is processed, stored, and used for energy prediction (with ML + Open-Meteo API). A Next.js frontend provides a live dashboard and a chatbot interface for user interaction. Click at the pillars description to go to the repositories

| Pillar    | Description | Key Features | Technologies |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| [**IoT (ESP32)**](https://github.com/Ramahabir/Solar-Panel) | Collects real-world solar panel data from sensors and sends it to the backend. | - Reads power (INA219)<br>- Reads temperature & humidity (DHT22)<br>- Packages data as JSON<br>- Sends via MQTT to backend | ESP32, INA219, DHT22, MQTT |
| [**Backend (FastAPI)**](https://github.com/Ramahabir/MLearning) | Acts as the data hub: stores IoT data, generates predictions, and powers the chatbot. | - `GET /sensor` → receive sensor JSON<br>- `GET /predict` → forecast solar power (irradiance, ambient temp, module temp → predicted power)<br>- `POST /chat` → LangGraph chatbot powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash with solar panel RAG | FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Open-Meteo API, Scikit-learn, LangGraph, Gemini 2.5 Flash |
| [**Frontend (Next.js)**](https://github.com/Ramahabir/solar-power-website)  | User interface for monitoring and interacting with the system. | - `/dashboard` → real-time charts with Recharts<br>- `/insight` → historical data + predictions<br>- `/setting` → configuration panel<br>- `/chatbot` → AI chatbot interface | Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, Recharts |



## 💻 Front End ( Next.js )
The frontend is built with Next.js + React, styled with TailwindCSS, and uses Recharts for data visualization. It provides a modern and responsive interface where users can explore live sensor data, predictions, and interact with the chatbot.

### 🌐 Routes

1. /dashboard

    - Displays real-time sensor data (voltage, current, power, temperature).

    - Interactive line & bar charts (Recharts) for:

        - Power vs Time

        - Temperature vs Time

        - Daily Energy Summary

    - Auto-refreshes data via backend API.

2. /insight

    - Provides analytics & predictions from the backend.

    - Shows historical trends (daily, weekly, monthly).

    - Displays ML-powered future energy forecasts.

    - Correlation graphs (e.g., temperature vs power efficiency).

3. /setting

    - User configuration panel.

    - Options to adjust:

        - IoT Integration
        - Panel Specification
4. /chatbot

    - Interactive AI chatbot interface.

    - Users can ask questions like:

        - “What’s my total energy today?”

        - “Show me yesterday’s performance.”

        - “Predict my solar output for tomorrow.”

    - Connected to LangGraph + FastAPI backend, fetching live data & predictions.

## 🔧 Backend
The backend acts as the data hub for the system, providing:

 - Data ingestion from IoT devices (ESP32).

 - Prediction service for solar panel performance.

 - Chatbot service powered by LangGraph + Gemini 2.5 Flash with RAG.

 - API endpoints consumed by the Next.js frontend.

### 📡 Api Routes
1. __POST /data__

Receives JSON data from IoT devices (ESP32)

**Payload Example**:

    {
    "timestamp": "2025-08-19T10:00:00Z",
    "voltage": 12.5,
    "current": 1.2,
    "power": 15.0,
    "ambient_temp": 32.4,
    "module_temp": 35.1,
    "irradiance": 820
    }

2. __GET /predict__

Generates solar power output predictions based on irradiance, ambient temperature, and module temperature.

Uses Open-Meteo API for weather forecast data.

Applies ML model trained on historical sensor + weather data.

**Response Example**:

    {
    "timestamp": "2025-08-20T10:00:00Z",
    "irradiance": 810,
    "ambient_temp": 30.2,
    "module_temp": 33.5,
    "predicted_power_output": 14.7
    }

3. __POST /chat__

Backend route for LangGraph chatbot.

- Powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash.

- Uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with solar panel condition data (from DB + predictions).

- Allows natural language interaction with system insights.

**Example Input**:

    { "message": "What is my predicted power output tomorrow?" }


**Example Output**:

    {
    "response": "Based on tomorrow’s forecast, your panels are expected to produce around 15.2W at peak hours, with higher efficiency in the morning due to lower module temperatures."
    }
